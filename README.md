Ensure you have the required dependencies in your `build.gradle` file and set up your Firebase project for authentication and Firestore.

## Usage

1. **Sign Up / Login**: Use the app to create a new account or log in with existing credentials.
2. **Search for Songs**: Navigate to the search feature to find your favorite songs.
3. **Play Music**: Click on any song to start playback.
4. **Manage Playlists**: Create or modify playlists from the library section.
5. **Add to Queue**: Use the three-dot menu to add songs to the playback queue.
6. **Access Current Song**: Tap on the current song to view details and control playback.

## App Architecture

Kittunes follows a modular architecture with a clear separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data layers. The architecture includes Activities, Fragments, ViewModels, and a Firebase backend.

## Key Components

### Activity and Fragment Structure

- **MainActivity**: The primary entry point of the app, which hosts the main user interface and fragments.
- **SearchFragment**: Handles song searches and displays results using a RecyclerView.
- **LibraryFragment**: Displays user playlists and allows for playlist management.
- **SongDetailBottomFragment**: Displays the current song's details and controls playback.

### ViewModel Integration

- **SharedViewModel**: Manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way. It stores playlists and manages the playback queue. This ViewModel is shared across multiple fragments to ensure data consistency.

### Firebase Integration

- **Authentication**: Users can sign up and log in using Firebase Authentication. This process is handled within the app, allowing for secure user management.
- **Firestore**: User-specific playlists are stored in Firestore. When users add songs to playlists, the app checks for existing playlists and updates them or creates new ones as necessary.

### Media Playback

- **MediaPlayer**: A single instance of `MediaPlayer` is used to handle all music playback. This ensures consistent playback behavior across the app.
- **SeekBar**: Allows users to seek through songs. It updates in real-time based on the current playback position.

## Technologies Used

- **Android Development**: Kotlin, XML
- **Firebase**: Authentication, Firestore for data storage
- **UI Frameworks**: Material Design for a responsive user interface
- **Android Architecture Components**: ViewModel, LiveData, and Fragment

## How It Works

1. **User Authentication**: Users can sign up or log in using Firebase Authentication. Upon successful login, user-specific data is fetched from Firestore.
  
2. **Searching for Songs**: The app utilizes Firestore to fetch songs based on user search queries. The results are displayed in the `SearchFragment` using a `RecyclerView` and `SearchAdapter`.

3. **Playing Music**: When a user clicks on a song, the `SongDetailBottomFragment` displays the song details. The `MediaPlayer` instance starts playback, and the UI updates with the current song details.

4. **Managing Playlists**: Users can create or modify new playlists. The app interacts with Firestore to store playlist data and song additions.

5. **Queue Management**: The `SharedViewModel` maintains a queue of songs for playback. Users can seamlessly navigate to the next or previous song.

6. **Persistent State**: The app uses `SharedPreferences` to store user preferences and the current state of playback. This allows users to resume where they left off when they reopen the app.
